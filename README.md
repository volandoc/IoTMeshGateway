# Introduction
Now a wide variety of IoT devices running on different technologies and protocols. They can use wireless technology (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZWave, NFC, etc.), or wired technologies (Ethernet, OneWire, I2C, SPI). These devices can control other physical devices, or be terminal primitives.

Lack of common standards limits the ability to use all IoT devices that exactly needed in a particular situation.

IoTMeshGateway - project, which was created for combining different devices running on different standards and protocols, and to help them communicate with each other.

# Configuration
There are basic configiration files in [conf](conf/) folder.

[gw.properties](conf/gw.properties) - contains configuration for core component and ro POCO Logger instances.

Any other configuration can be placed in any place by desire. For example InnerBus core component has its own configuration file in component folder.
In same way all components can utilize POCO::Configuration library and store their own configuration.

# Sponsors
This work unable to imagine without [GloblLogic](https://www.globallogic.com/) sponsorship about H/W and people time contribution.

This project could be marked as Globallogic PoC.
