Environment
===========

EmbGateway running on Linux systems with libc6 (for running only) and GNU C-C++ compiler version 5.0.0 or newer (for running and compiling). Tested on Ubuntu 14.0.4, Ubuntu 16.0.4, Debian Jessie and clons for x86, amd64, arm, ramhf and armhf64 platforms

All you need it's install linux distributive that you prefer and update libc and GNU compiler.

If you want to compile project for another platform you also need tool-chains for this platform.

If you want another editor instead Vi, nano or MC :) You can use QT-Creator, as project already include QT-Creator project files. You must add "make" build steps to all QT-Creator environment - "make install"
